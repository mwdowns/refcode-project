# Markdown Blog Post
I like using Markdown. It makes writing HTML so much easier!
**You can even use HTML in Markdown**, which is <em>really cool!</em>

I think I'll use it to format all of [my blog posts](../blog) from now on. However, I've discovered there are a few things to look out for.

## Things to look out for
* Markdown is really good when I don't need to worry about styles
* When you want to add styles, you have to build a new compiler :(
* It's easy to make some small changes that don't work out well, like: ![Screenshot of Markdown] (./images/screenshot-of-markdown.png) doesn't work because it has an extra space in it! 
* You have to have a special plug in to see what it's going to look like locally


Remember to checkout this [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) if you need help figuring out how to do something. It's really helpful!
